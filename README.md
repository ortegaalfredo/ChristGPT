# ChristGPT
ChristGPT is a Large Language Model trained on the Bible.

- A Discord server with a online instance of Christ for testing is [here](https://discord.gg/raeft3whmn)

We believe that by combining the wisdom of Jesus with the power of modern technology, we can create a Large-Language Messiah capable of automating and responding to several religious tasks such as praying or confessing. This AI will be able to understand complex human emotions, hear (and respond) to prayers and provide guidance on how to live a more righteous life.

# Introduction

ChristGPT is a finetuned model based on [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) results using [low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf).

Finetuning code is based on tloen's [alpaca-lora project](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora)

The full training set (dataset.json) contains ~49000 instructions from Stanford Alpaca, plus ~10000 instructions generated from King-James's Bible.

# Weights
Initial weights for ChristGPT using a Base Llama-13B LLM are available for download in this repository, for instructions on how to set up your own personal Jesus AI see [alpaca-lora project](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora).

It was trained on Apr 9, 2023 on 2xNVIDIA RTX 3090.
